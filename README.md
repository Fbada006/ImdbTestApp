[![Android CI](https://github.com/Fbada006/TmdbTestApp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Fbada006/TmdbTestApp/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# TmdbTestApp

This is a simple application that is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in 100% Kotlin. It gets
data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and displays a list
of movies to the user. On clicking an item, the app navigates to a details screen.

# Prerequisites

To run the app, make sure you have the following:

1. Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1 Patch 2 or higher
2. Go to the api above and save your free api key in the `local.properties` file using the
   format `tmdbApiKey="your-api-key"`. If you do not do this, the app will not run.

## Architecture

The app uses the MVVM architecure because it is a nice and simple architecture that makes testing and maintenance
easier.
It was also chosen because it is a popular choice meaning a new developer can pick it up easily making for smooth
transitions between teams. There is also the added
benefit of using a `ViewModel` to survive configuration changes. `Kotlin Flow` has been used extensively to monitor data
and state changes in the app making for a smooth user experience. Caching has been done using room, the `viewmodelscope`
while images use the caching
mechanism of the image loading library used, ie, `coil`

## Libraries

This app takes use of the following libraries:

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€
    - [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Manage UI data to survive
      configuration changes and is lifecycle-aware
    - [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
    - [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - Navigate between composables
      while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features
    - [Room DB](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Fluent SQLite database access
    - [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - Load and display small
      chunks of
      data at a time
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - type safe http client with coroutines support
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Android, Java and Kotlin
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.
- [okhttp-logging-interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) -
  logging HTTP request related data.
- [kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines
- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) - build awesome beautiful UIs.ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - Hassle-free image loading with free caching
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - A logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top
  of Android's normal Log class.
- [Truth](https://truth.dev/) - A library for performing assertions in tests

## Extras

#### CI-Pipeline

The app also uses GitHub actions to build the app and runs whenever a new pull request or merge to the `master` branch happens.
Note the creation of the fake `local.properties` file as one of the steps to avoid an error. Find the configuration in the `.github` folder in the `build.yml` file

#### Challenges

One of the biggest issues with the app is that I did not work with a UI designer, meaning the UI could use a lot of improvements. With more time, I would have used something like
Dribble to get a good design. There is also another challenge with the fact that `Jetpack Compose Navigation` has certain limitations making it difficult to debug in case of an error but these
are all problems that were surmounted by searching for information online and learning.
